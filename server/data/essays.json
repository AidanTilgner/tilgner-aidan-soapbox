    "title": "Cats are awesome",
    "content": "Domestic pets are a source of pleasure and fun. Most boys and girls love to keep pets. Pets help an individual to achieve a healthy state of mind and playing with our pets makes most of us happy.\n\nThough dogs are the most preferred pets because of their faithfulness and honesty, but still there are thousands of cat lovers in the world.\n\nThe cat is a beautiful small animal resembling the likes of a tiger. It lives on the streets as well as in our houses and is one of our favourite pet animals. The cat’s body is covered with soft, silky hair and has four short legs and sharp claws hidden in the fleshy pads.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nCats seldom make any noise while walking or running. Cats have bright eyes and they can even see in the dark. Cat is found all over the world and milk is cats favourite. Many people keep cats as their pets to scare away the mice. But unlike dogs, cats are selfish and dishonest. Cats even steal food from our kitchen and are very ferocious at times.\n\nBut in general cats are gentle and playful and they love playing with the children. Many people think that cat is a harmful animal for it spreads various disease like diphtheria and thus they advice to keep children away from the cat. Some people also associate black magic with a cat.\n\nThe most significant superstition related to the cat is that if a cat crosses the way of a passerby, he or she should not walk past. This is just a superstition because common sense says that when a cat crosses a road it means that the animal needs to go somewhere. It is as simple as that.\n\nCats possess scary grey coloured eyes and most of the children are scared of cat’s eyes. A cat gives birth to three to four kittens at a time and these kittens need proper love and care when they are born. Taming a cat is not difficult if one is determined to do so. When it comes to food, a variety of cat food is available in the market with various options such as canned cat foot, dry foods, kitten food etc.",

    "content": "The Democratic party is often associated with the colour blue and the donkey mascot.\n\nThat dates back to Democratic candidate Andrew Jackson's 1828 presidential campaign, when opponents called him a \"jackass\" for his stubbornness.\n\nInstead of taking the nickname as an insult, Jackson embraced it and used the donkey image on his election posters.\n\nIt was then quickly adopted by newspapers and political cartoonists.\n\nThe Republican's elephant symbol came along years later.\n\nMany believe it came about, in part, due to a widely used expression during the Civil War led by Republican president Abraham Lincoln.\n\nSoldiers entering battle were said to be \"seeing the elephant\" — a phrase that means learning a hard lesson, often with a profound cost.\n\nThe symbol was then popularised by political cartoonist Thomas Nast; an early rendition featured in the 1879 edition of Harper's Weekly.\n\nBoth symbols are still largely used for political campaigns.",

    "thesis": "Global warming is bad",
    "title": "I don't like global warming",
    "content": "Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperature has increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 1880—the year that accurate recordkeeping began—and 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees Celsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) every 10 years. Since 1981, however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For the last 40 years, we’ve seen the global annual temperature rise by 0.18 degrees Celsius, or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade.\n\nThe result? A planet that has never been hotter. Nine of the 10 warmest years since 1880 have occurred since 2005—and the 5 warmest years on record have all occurred since 2015. Climate change deniers have argued that there has been a “pause” or a “slowdown” in rising global temperatures, but numerous studies, including a 2018 paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, have disproved this claim. The impacts of global warming are already harming people around the world.\n\nNow climate scientists have concluded that we must limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040 if we are to avoid a future in which everyday life around the world is marked by its worst, most devastating effects: the extreme droughts, wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and other disasters that we refer to collectively as climate change. These effects are felt by all people in one way or another but are experienced most acutely by the underprivileged, the economically marginalized, and people of color, for whom climate change is often a key driver of poverty, displacement, hunger, and social unrest.",

Within the next five years, we can expect AI and machine learning to become imbedded in all forms of technology that incorporate data exchange and analysis. The opportunities this creates are immense, ranging from new services and breakthroughs in science, to the augmentation of human intelligence and its convergence with the digital world.\n\nThere are considerable uncertainties about AI, including the delegation of decision-making to machines, lack of transparency and whether technological change will outpace the development of governance and policy norms. Automation may profoundly change industry, affecting employment and the delivery of public services. Governments and societies need to prepare now for its effects.   \n",

    "title": "The Percerverence rover is awesome",
    "content": "NASA’s Perseverance rover has been busy serving as a communications base station for the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter and documenting the rotorcraft’s historic flights. But the rover has also been busy focusing its science instruments on rocks that lay on the floor of Jezero Crater.\n\nWhat insights they turn up will help scientists create a timeline of when an ancient lake formed there, when it dried, and when sediment began piling up in the delta that formed in the crater long ago. Understanding this timeline should help date rock samples – to be collected later in the mission – that might preserve a record of ancient microbes.\n\nA camera called WATSON on the end of the rover’s robotic arm has taken detailed shots of the rocks. A pair of zoomable cameras that make up the Mastcam-Z imager on the rover’s “head” has also surveyed the terrain. And a laser instrument called SuperCam has zapped some of the rocks to detect their chemistry. These instruments and others allow scientists to learn more about Jezero Crater and to home in on areas they might like to study in greater depth.\n\nOne important question scientists want to answer: whether these rocks are sedimentary (like sandstone) or igneous (formed by volcanic activity). Each type of rock tells a different kind of story. Some sedimentary rocks – formed in the presence of water from rock and mineral fragments like sand, silt, and clay – are better suited to preserving biosignatures, or signs of past life. Igneous rocks, on the other hand, are more precise geological clocks that allow scientists to create an accurate timeline of how an area formed.\n\nOne complicating factor is that the rocks around Perseverance have been eroded by wind over time and covered with younger sand and dust. On Earth, a geologist might trudge into the field and break a rock sample open to get a better idea of its origins. “When you look inside a rock, that’s where you see the story,” said Ken Farley of Caltech, Perseverance’s project scientist.\n\nWhile Perseverance doesn’t have a rock hammer, it does have other ways to peer past millennia’s worth of dust. When scientists find a particularly enticing spot, they can reach out with the rover’s arm and use an abrader to grind and flatten a rock’s surface, revealing its internal structure and composition. Once they’ve done that, the team gathers more detailed chemical and mineralogical information using arm instruments called PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry) and SHERLOC (Scanning for Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals).\n\n“The more rocks you look at, the more you know,” Farley said.\n\nAnd the more the team knows, the better samples they can ultimately collect with the drill on the rover’s arm. The best ones will be stored in special tubes and deposited in collections on the planet’s surface for eventual return to Earth.",
